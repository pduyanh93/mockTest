1. Service Modularization
A CDN can be broken down into the following key components or services, each with a specific responsibility:

a. Content Delivery Service (Edge Nodes)
Functionality: These are the servers located at various geographic locations (edge locations) that serve cached static assets to end-users. The content delivery service is responsible for routing requests to the nearest edge node to minimize latency.
Responsibilities:
Handle incoming HTTP requests from users.
Serve cached content when available.
Forward requests to the origin server if content is not cached locally.
b. Origin Server
Functionality: This is the central server where the original version of static assets (images, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) is stored. The origin server serves as the source of truth for the content.
Responsibilities:
Store the original, unmodified content.
Handle cache misses from edge nodes (when content is not available at the edge).
c. Cache Management Service
Functionality: Responsible for managing the cache lifecycle (TTL, invalidation, and purging). This service determines when to cache content, how long to cache it, and when to invalidate the cache.
Responsibilities:
Enforce caching policies (e.g., setting TTL for content).
Invalidate cached content when the origin content is updated.
Coordinate cache updates with edge nodes.
d. Content Ingestion Service
Functionality: Handles the uploading and management of content to the origin server, ensuring that assets are efficiently replicated and distributed to edge locations.
Responsibilities:
Upload assets to the origin.
Manage asset versioning and metadata.
Trigger cache invalidation or refresh operations when new content is uploaded.
e. Global Load Balancer
Functionality: Directs traffic to the appropriate edge node based on factors such as geography, load, and health of the edge nodes. This ensures that users are always served by the nearest or healthiest available server.
Responsibilities:
Route user requests to the nearest, least-loaded edge node.
Monitor the health of edge nodes and reroute traffic in case of failure.
f. Monitoring and Analytics Service
Functionality: Tracks the performance, availability, and health of the CDN infrastructure, including cache hit/miss ratios, server load, and content delivery times.
Responsibilities:
Monitor cache hit/miss ratios to identify optimization opportunities.
Track edge node health and availability.
Provide real-time metrics for optimization and debugging.
2. Caching Mechanisms
Caching is one of the most critical aspects of a CDN, as it reduces load on the origin server and ensures faster content delivery. The caching system needs to be effective at both the edge (local caches) and origin levels. Here’s how caching can be implemented at different levels:

a. Edge Cache (Local Cache)
Functionality: Edge nodes store copies of frequently accessed content to serve to users quickly, reducing the need to fetch the same content from the origin server repeatedly.
Caching Strategies:
Time-to-Live (TTL): Set cache expiration times for each asset. Static assets like images and CSS files often have long TTLs (e.g., weeks or months), while dynamic content may have short TTLs.
Cache Key: Cache based on a unique cache key, which could be the URL or URL + query string + headers (e.g., user-agent for personalized content).
Cache Purging/Invalidation: When content is updated, cache at the edge should be invalidated or refreshed. This can be achieved using cache invalidation signals sent from the origin or cache management service.
b. Origin Cache
Functionality: The origin server can also cache content before it’s served to the edge nodes, but it serves as the last-resort fallback when content is not available at the edge.
Caching Strategies:
Cache-Control Headers: Define caching policies using HTTP headers (e.g., Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600).
Versioning: Use versioned URLs (e.g., styles-v1.css) to ensure that new content replaces the old one and that cache invalidation works correctly.
c. Cache Hierarchy
Content can be cached at multiple levels:
Edge Cache: Fastest and most local cache.
Origin Cache: Intermediate fallback cache before fetching from the actual origin.
Centralized Cache: A layer between origin and edge that caches content on a regional basis (for regions with high traffic but no nearby edge node).
3. Redundancy and Failover
Ensuring high availability and resilience is crucial for a CDN. To achieve this, we can implement several strategies:

a. Geographically Distributed Edge Nodes
Redundancy: Deploy edge nodes in multiple geographic regions and availability zones to ensure content is available even if one location fails.
Failover: If an edge node or an entire region becomes unavailable, the global load balancer should automatically reroute traffic to the next nearest available edge node.
b. Replication and Synchronization of Content
Redundancy: The origin server should be highly available, potentially replicated across multiple locations. Content should be synchronized across these origin replicas.
Failover: If one origin server is down, the CDN can fail over to another origin server (through the global load balancer or a DNS-based failover mechanism).
c. Health Checks and Monitoring
The global load balancer should continuously monitor the health of edge nodes and origin servers. If an edge node fails, traffic should be rerouted to the next best option, minimizing downtime and improving resilience.
d. Data Replication for Consistency
Ensure that data (content, metadata, cache status) is replicated across edge nodes and origin servers to maintain consistency. This prevents single points of failure.
4. Data Consistency
Ensuring users receive up-to-date content without overwhelming the system with constant checks for content updates requires balancing performance with consistency.

a. Cache Invalidation and Updates
Versioning: Assets like images and CSS files should use versioning in their URLs. When content is updated at the origin, the CDN can serve the new version by simply changing the URL (e.g., image_v1.jpg to image_v2.jpg).
Cache Invalidation: When the origin content changes, the cache management service can notify edge nodes to invalidate their cached copies of outdated content. This could be triggered by an event (e.g., file upload, change) and propagated across edge nodes.
b. Consistent Hashing
To maintain consistency in how content is served from different edge nodes, use consistent hashing techniques to distribute content evenly across edge locations, ensuring that updates to specific content are propagated to the right locations.
c. Stale-While-Revalidate
For non-critical content or content that doesn’t change frequently, implement a stale-while-revalidate caching strategy. This allows the CDN to serve stale content while fetching the updated content from the origin asynchronously, so users aren't affected by minor delays.
d. Content Delivery with HTTP/2 or HTTP/3
Using modern protocols like HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 improves the efficiency of content delivery and reduces latency. These protocols support multiplexing multiple requests over a single connection, reducing the overhead of delivering content to users.
Summary of the Architecture

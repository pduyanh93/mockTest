Conclusion
To efficiently manage and query time-series data in MongoDB, you need to focus on:

1.Data Partitioning: Use sharding and time-based bucketing to scale the database horizontally while keeping query performance high.
2.Indexing: Create appropriate indexes (compound, TTL, geospatial) to support time-range queries, filtering by additional fields, and efficient sorting.
3.Efficient Querying: Leverage range queries, the aggregation framework, and MongoDB's time-series collection feature to analyze and retrieve IoT data efficiently.
4.Retention and Archiving: Use TTL indexes and partitioning strategies to manage data retention and ensure that only relevant data is retained.
